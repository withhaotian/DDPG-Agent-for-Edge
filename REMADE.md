# CoPace: Edge Computation Offloading and Caching for Self-Driving With Deep Reinforcement Learning
This repository is the implementation of the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) proposed in the paper "CoPace: Edge Computation Offloading and Caching for Self-Driving With Deep Reinforcement Learning," in *IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology* (2021). This myDDPG_agent.py is a tailored DRL agent to realize the joint computation offloading, content caching, and resources allocation (including computation and communication) for self-driving vehicles in edge computing systems.

## Quick start
You can integrate myDDPG agent of CoPace into your own DRL env to sovle the optimization problems in edge computing with your formulated system models.

## Requirements
Tensorflow == 1.15.0

Python == 3.7
